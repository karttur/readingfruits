## Spaceborne detection of localized carbon dioxide sources

[The observed values of (enhancement of the column-averaged dry-air CO2 mole fraction) correspond to in situ CO2 enhancements of 10-fold or higher. ... Although the carbon budget is often presented in terms of global-scale fluxes, many of the contributing processes actually occur through localized point sources, which have been challenging to measure from space.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aam5690)
