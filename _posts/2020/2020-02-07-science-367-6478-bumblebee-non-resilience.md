## Discovering the limits of ecological resilience

[Despite increasingly precise predictions of rises in average temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events, biologists still cannot predict how ecological communities will respond to these changes. This means that scientists cannot predict where, and at what rates of climate change, ecosystems will stop providing the rainfall, decomposition, and biological productivity on which all economies depend. Another key unknown is to what extent ongoing habitat and biodiversity loss reduces the ability of ecological communities to evolve in response to the climate crisis.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aba6432)
