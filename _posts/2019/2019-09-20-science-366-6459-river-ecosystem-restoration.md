## Linkages between flow regime, biota, and ecosystem processes: Implications for river restoration

[ The rise in river degradation globally has motivated research on the link between hydrologic alteration and declines in valued biota. ... Todayâ€™s hydroecological science seeks to understand the mechanisms whereby flow regimes affect biota and ecosystem processes, and the interplay between them, in a three-way interaction we call the flow-biota-ecosystem processes nexus.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aaw2087)
