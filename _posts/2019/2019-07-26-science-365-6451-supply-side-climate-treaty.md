## The case for a supply-side climate treaty

Interesting policy option for mitigating/abating climate change.

[To restrict carbon emissions caused by fossil fuel combustion, one must regulate fossil fuel demand or supply, or both. Supply-side policies regulate exploration and extraction of fossil fuels, whereas demand-side policies regulate the combustion of fossil fuels. In the Paris Agreement—a demand-side treaty—each country regulates combustion of fossil fuels by restricting emissions within its own borders. If all fossil fuel production (carbon extracted) or consumption (carbon combusted) were covered, regulating either supply or demand could suffice](DOI: 10.1126/science.aax5011)
