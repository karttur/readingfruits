## Cleaning up plastic pollution in Africa

[Plastic waste pollution, aggravated by inefficient waste collection and limited recycling capabilities, is prevalent across Africa. However, the continent also has a growing, youthful population that values improving the quality of life and readily adopts technologies toward this end (1). This makes Africa especially suitable as a testbed to investigate the effectiveness of new technologies for solving environmental problems. In addition to consumers pushing brands to be more environmentally responsible, a business case also exists in Africa that enables brands to invest in technologies that promote a circular economy. As such, a trend for plastic waste remediation efforts in Africa that relies principally on consumer engagement to create a plastics circular economy has emerged (2).](DOI: 10.1126/science.aax3539)
