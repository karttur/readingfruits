## Pantropical climate interactions

[However, ocean-atmosphere interactions internal to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are capable of generating distinct modes of climate variability as well. ... Here we review advances in our understanding of pantropical interbasin climate interactions and their implications for both climate prediction and future climate projections. ... These interactions forced from the tropical Atlantic were largely responsible for the recent hiatus in global surface warming.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aav4236)
