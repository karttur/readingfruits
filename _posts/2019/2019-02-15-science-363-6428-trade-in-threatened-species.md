## Long delays in banning trade in threatened species

[We find that in nearly two-thirds of the cases, the CITES process of regulating trade in threatened species lags considerably behind the IUCN identification of species in need of protection from trade. ... This resulted in 958 threatened species for which we can link international trade as a factor in their endangerment. Scientific knowledge should be applied with more urgency.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aav4013)
