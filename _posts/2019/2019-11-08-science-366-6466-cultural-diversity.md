[One of the biggest puzzles facing the social sciences is understanding our immense cultural variation. Over the past several thousand years, humanity has evolved to the point where there now exist 195 countries, more than 7000 languages, and thousands of religions. Research has begun to describe psychological variation across the globe (1–4), yet only recently have we begun to understand ecological, historical, and sociopolitical factors that produce such differences.

## Single-nanowire spectrometers

[Miniaturizing spectrometers Spectroscopy is a ubiquitous characterization tool spanning most scientific and many industrial disciplines. Most handheld spectrometers are based on tabletop optical components, which limits the scale to which these spectrometers can be shrunk. ... A variety of miniaturized, portable spectrometers have been developed for applications in which reduced footprint and weight take precedence over high resolution.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aax8814)
