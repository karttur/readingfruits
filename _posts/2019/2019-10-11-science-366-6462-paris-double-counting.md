## Miniaturizing spectrometer

[That's where mass spectrometers are, I would argue, one of the single most advantageous tools, because with a single analyzer you can detect a wide array of compounds," says Girguis.There's no denying the incredible power of mass spectrometry. ... The shrinking of mass spectrometers is really about doing in situ, on-site measurements," Cooks says. ... As a result, most mini-mass specs are built from more forgiving mass analyzers, namely ion traps and quadrupolesâ€”though at least two researchers have succeeded in miniaturizing a TOF, including Verbeck.](DOI: 10.1126/science.opms.p1400082)

## Single-nanowire spectrometers

[Miniaturizing spectrometers Spectroscopy is a ubiquitous characterization tool spanning most scientific and many industrial disciplines. Most handheld spectrometers are based on tabletop optical components, which limits the scale to which these spectrometers can be shrunk. ... A variety of miniaturized, portable spectrometers have been developed for applications in which reduced footprint and weight take precedence over high resolution.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aax8814)
