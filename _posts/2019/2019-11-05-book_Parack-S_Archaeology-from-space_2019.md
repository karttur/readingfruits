## Archaeology from space - how the future shapes our past

by Sarah Parcak

### p 21

Corona images
Rubber sheeting

### p 35

Apart from CORONA, there obviously are two more sensors LANYARD and ARGON. And a bit about them, how they were collected and released by Bill Clinton.

### p 36

The first weather satellites (TIROS) and ERTS-1 that became Landsat 1.

### p 38

Shuttle radar data detected paleo-channels of the Nile and other rivers in the Sahara. Reference to Science article: Subsurface Valleys and Geoarcheology of the Eastern Sahara Revealed by Shuttle Radar, By J. F. McCAULEY, et al. | Dec 3rd, 1982, DOI: 10.1126/science.218.4576.1004
Science Vol. 218, No. 4576.

### p 121

Detecting shipwrecks. Underwater remote sensing, underwater drones that are useful for that.  www.openrov.com

### p 133

On the Nile River, and how vriations in the annual flood contributed to the fall of the Old Kingdom.

### p 148

On SRTM and data processing of the raw data. Could be interesting to test.

### p 151

Silt depth of 5 m since Old Kingdom (4000 years), seems quite a lot.

### p 173

Hyperspectral data and handheld spectrometers, including references.

### p 174

Thermal remote sensing

### p 175

Groundbased measurement devices, ground radar, magnetometer, resistivity, ultrasonic waves, laser, phase contrast X-ray. Interactive data analysis at time of acquisition.

### p 176

Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
