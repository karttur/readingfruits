## New plant breeding technologies for food security

[Here, we argue that with careful deployment and scientifically informed regulation, new plant breeding technologies (NPBTs) such as genome editing will be able to contribute substantially to global food security. ... A concerted development plan for priority traits in food crops, including orphan crops, should be elaborated, which would help to demonstrate more broadly the large potential of new breeding technologies for food security in developing countries.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aav6316)
