## Seasonal to multiannual marine ecosystem prediction with a global Earth system model

[The ability to predict how climate variations will affect marine ecosystems would allow better economic and ecosystem planning and management. Park et al. found that a global Earth system model skillfully predicted seasonal to multiannual ocean chlorophyll fluctuations in many regions. This could allow annual fish catches in some regions to be forecast 2 to 3 years in advance.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aav6634)
