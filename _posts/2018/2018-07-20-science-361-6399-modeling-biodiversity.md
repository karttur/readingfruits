## Modeling the ecology and evolution of biodiversity: Biogeographical cradles, museums, and graves

[The emergence, distribution, and extinction of species are driven by interacting factorsâ€”spatial, temporal, physical, and biotic. ... The processes and parameters implemented in the model, all illustrated here, link climate dynamics and topography to emerging biodiversity patterns.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aar5452)
