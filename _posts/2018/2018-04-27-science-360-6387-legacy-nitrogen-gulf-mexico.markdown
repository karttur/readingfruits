## Legacy nitrogen may prevent achievement of water quality goals in the Gulf of Mexico

[Legacy nitrogen may prevent achievement of water quality goals in the Gulf of Mexico K. ... This legacy effect means that a dramatic shift in land-use practices, which may not be compatible with current levels of agricultural production, will be needed to control hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. ... It has been estimated that a 60% decrease in watershed nitrogen (N) loading may be necessary to adequately reduce eutrophication in the Gulf.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aav6886)
