## The seasonal fingerprint of climate change

[Several factors could explain the absence of pooling in this arena: the need for at least some market exclusivity in an environment with extremely high costs of product development, clinical trials, and regulatory approval; patent holders' desire to retain control over their assets; and concerns over compromising commercial secrecy by collaborating with others.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aau2405)

## Human influence on the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature

[Anthropogenic climate change has become clearly observable through many metrics. These include an increase in global annual temperatures, growing heat content of the oceans, and sea level rise owing to the melting of the polar ice sheets and glaciers. Now, Santer et al. report that a human-caused signal in the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperature can also be measured (see the Perspective by Randel). They use satellite data and the anthropogenic “fingerprint” predicted by climate models to show the extent of the effects and discuss how these changes have been caused.](DOI: 10.1126/science.aas8806)
