## A 90,000-year record of Afromontane forest responses to climate change

[The upper treeline moved in response to climate change during the Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods, whereas the lower limit of the Afromontane forest was stable. ... This record resolves debates concerning the biogeographic history of Afromontane vegetation. ... Such ecological instability may have had a critical influence on species richness in the Afromontane forests](DOI: 10.1126/science.aav6821)
